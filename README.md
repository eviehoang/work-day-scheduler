# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
![](assets/images/sshot.png)
Developed a workday scheduling application utilizing Bootstrap, jQuery, and Day.js. This scheduler allows users to input tasks, which are then stored in the local storage upon clicking the "Save" button. Whenever a task is successfully added, a modal popup appears. Additionally, the application displays the current time, updating every second. To reset and clear the task list stored in local storage, a "Clear List" button is available for users to start over.
